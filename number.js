/*
Number squaring
Complete the following program so that the square1() and square2() functions work properly.
*/

// Square the given number x
function square1(x) {
  return Math.pow(x, 2)
}
console.log(square1(0)); // Must show 0
console.log(square1(2)); // Must show 4
console.log(square1(5)); // Must show 25

// Square the given number x
const square2 = x => x ** 2

console.log(square2(0)); // Must show 0
console.log(square2(2)); // Must show 4
console.log(square2(5)); // Must show 25

//When it's done, update the program so that it shows the square of every number between 0 and 10.

//Writing 10 dumb calls to square() is forbidden! You know how to repeat statements, don't you? ;)
