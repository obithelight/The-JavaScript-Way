/*
Modeling a bank account
Write a program that creates an account object with the following characteristics:
*/

//A name property set to "Alex".
//A balance property set to 0.
//A credit method adding the (positive or negative) value passed as an argument to the account balance.
//A describe method returning the account description.
//Use this object to show its description, crediting 250, debiting 80, then show its description again.

    this.debitAmount = +prompt("Enter debit amount")
  },
